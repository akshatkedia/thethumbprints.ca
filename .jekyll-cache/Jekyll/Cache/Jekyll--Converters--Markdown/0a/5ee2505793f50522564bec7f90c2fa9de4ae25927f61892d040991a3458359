I"‘<p>A very serene and beautiful Deer couple, inspired by the abundance and variety of Antlers in central India. The artist has made these showing the two deer looking at each other seemingly adoring each other. They symbolize intuition, love, affection, fertility and kindness as per the artist. They are very well made with brass on the outside and look extremely elegant where were they are kept</p>
