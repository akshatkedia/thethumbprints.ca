I"E<p>Go Ahead. Twirl it. Swing it. Keep swinging it. Hear that? Yesâ€¦ that light whistling sound is coming from
this carved Bamboo Stick. Look through this Bastar Flute, its insides have been made methodically (using
metal coins with a hole in between) to make that light whistling sound. For the tribals of Bastar,
Chhattisgarh while travelling through forests with their sheep for grazing. This is an age old technique to
keep the sheep close and to guide the path as well.
Sometimes these flutes are also simply used while strolling on the streets or in traditional dancing.</p>
