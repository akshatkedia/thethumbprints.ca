I"Y<p>This is a very artistic and cool looking ash tray with three smoke stick holders. It makes a great style statement having it on the table. The artists who make this are inspired by the slow moving tortoise and obviously they smoke rolled joints and come up with such work. Made of solid brass a great art work to have on a smoking table.</p>
