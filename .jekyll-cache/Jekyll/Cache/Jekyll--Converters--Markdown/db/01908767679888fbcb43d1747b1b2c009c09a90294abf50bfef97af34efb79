I"p<p>Bastar is a mineral rich area and the original inhabitants started making very elaborate and artistic lamps using brass. This is a solid brass lamp and it signifies well being and spread of good cheer as the light spreads through its design and the non shinny but reflective surface. It can be hung as it is or you may want to put a lamp or candle if you want.</p>
