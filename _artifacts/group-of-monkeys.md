description: 'These sleek black monkeys are an art innovation made from a single piece
  of wrought iron; softened and folded into limbs and face. This set of 6 monkeys
  denotes that the artisans who make it are in observation and live in close proximity
  of these wild creatures. These can be arranged as per your mood: playing in a group,
  advancing collectively or backing away from an approaching danger.'
