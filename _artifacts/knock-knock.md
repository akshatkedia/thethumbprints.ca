description: Elephants hold a special happy place in the lives of Bastar tribals.
  These door knocks are for the front door symbolizing contentment in the lives of
  the people of the house. Made of pure brass, the elephant head welcomes everyone
  with its trunk held high in respect. Its perfectly shaped almond eyes emit a calming
  sensation within oneself.
