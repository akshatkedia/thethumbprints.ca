description: This is a unique representation of a horse but with two horns on the
  side. In the west we are aware of the Unicorn which is a horse with one horn. The
  tribal artist has imagined a ornamental decorated horse but having two horns on
  the side. It has a very full body signifying well being and vitality, the subdued
  face shows serenity but the pointed horns make a intriguing combination. A very
  unique and powerful statement is made by the artist in making this bronze Twonicorn
