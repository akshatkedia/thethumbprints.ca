description: 'This is an artists impression of a tribal queen who rules the tribe
  with focus and determination. The intricate sun tattoo on her forehead symbolizes
  that she is the all powerful queen, her eyes look beautiful but steely and the big
  ears symbolize that she listens and knows the happenings in her kingdom. This solid
  brass art work represents the empowerment and righteousness '
