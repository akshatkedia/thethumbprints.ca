description: 'Music is an integral part of the tribal culture since they have inhabited
  parts of central India. They use locally sourced materials like metal, wood, Jute
  ropes and hide to make instruments like drums and trumpets. Here you see three musicians
  who are dressed with ornate Jewelry signifying that they are playing for a joyous
  occasion and possibly playing songs to bring best wishes and celebration to all
  those listening to them. Made of brass on the outer side.   '
