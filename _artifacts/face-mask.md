description: This evil looking face mask is placed on top of the front door of the
  tribals’ houses to ward off envious glances given by passers-by. It is believed
  that a bigger house is a measurement of wealth and people’s envy will not allow
  the wealth to grow. Look at its penetrating devilish eyes and wide mischievous smirk.
  This mask is symbolized as a guarder from these envious judgments of people.
