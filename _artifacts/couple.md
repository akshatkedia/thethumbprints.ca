description: |
  This is a typical tribal couple; man playing the double headed drum (dhol) and the woman with a bamboo stick in her hand to dance with it to the tunes of the drum. Men decorate themselves with bison horns on their heads to exhibiting their masculinity. Men wear robust jewelry whereas women adorn cowry shelled jewelry, which jingles along their dances.
  Men and women do have different costumes but, notably, women of this tribe also do not cover the upper part of their body.
