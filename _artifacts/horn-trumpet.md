description: |
  This brass trumpet is the replica of the traditional bison horn trumpet ‘hakum’. It is one of the various naturally made musical instruments used by the adivasis of Central India during festivities or celebrations. Sound is made by holding it sideways and blowing into the hole. The sounds can be mixed with the tiny bells hanging below the trumpet. Do not miss the beautiful carvings done on the trumpet.
  Try it! Blow into it with all your might!
