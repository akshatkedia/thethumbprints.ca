description: 'Bastar is a mineral rich area and the original inhabitants started making
  very elaborate and artistic lamps using brass. This is a solid brass lamp and it
  signifies well being and spread of good cheer as the light spreads through its design
  and the non shinny but reflective surface. It can be hung as it is or you may want
  to put a lamp or candle if you want. '
